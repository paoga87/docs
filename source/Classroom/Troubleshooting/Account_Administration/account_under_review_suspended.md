SendGrid reviews accounts that appear to have abnormal activity in order to preserve your reputation as a sender. We apologize for any interruption in your service. The quickest way to reactivate your account is to **respond directly to the ticket sent to the email address associated with your SendGrid account.**

The possible states of review your account can be in are explained below:

{% anchor h2 %}Warned{% endanchor %}
The account maintains full functionality during a warning period. However, if we do not receive a response your account may be suspended to prevent further risk to your sending reputation.  
  
{% anchor h2 %}Suspended{% endanchor %}
SendGrid will accept and queue mail while the account is under review. Mail will be held until issues are resolved or up to 72 hours from the time of send. If mail is queued for over 72 hours from send, it will expire and not be delivered. _Please be aware that an account in a suspended state will continue to incur auto-renewal billing for your monthy subscription and any contacts storage._

{% anchor h2 %}Deactivated{% endanchor %}
SendGrid will not accept mail while an account is deactivated. Once deactivated, any undelivered mail that has been queued on SendGridâ€™s systems will be deleted. While the account is deactivated, click and open tracking links will be disabled. _Please be aware that an account in a deactivated state will continue to incur auto-renewal billing for your monthly subscription and any contacts storage._

{% anchor h2 %}Banned{% endanchor %}
All access to the account is blocked, both through SendGrid.com as well as the API. Email requests to our system will not be accepted. If an account has dedicated IP's assigned to it, they will be removed. Related sub-users will also be banned and unable to send email or access their account. _Please be aware that an account in a banned state will stop any auto-renewal billing, though you will still be charged for any overages or newsletter usage used during your final month._  
  
{% anchor h2 %}Reactivation{% endanchor %}
When all potential issues are resolved to our satisfaction, SendGrid will reactivate your service. At which point, your account will be restored and any queued messages will be delivered.

If you receive a warning, suspension, deactivation, or ban notice from SendGrid, **please respond to questions asked in the email notice.** The quickest way to reactivate your account is to respond directly to the ticket sent to your email address.
