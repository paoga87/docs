Is your credit card about to expire? Need to move over from your personal/testing card to the corporate one? Maybe you just need to have our system process a payment on the current card, now that it's funded. All of these issues can be handled on the  **[Plan and Billing Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) **page!

You can update your card information, retry a failed payment, and export past invoices for your business on the Plan and Billing Details page. It is also possible to change your package type and cancel your account from this page.
