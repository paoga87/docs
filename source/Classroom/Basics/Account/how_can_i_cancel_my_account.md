We're sorry to see anyone leave, but things happen and we totally understand. If you want to cancel your account, you will need to [log in](https://sendgrid.com/login) first and then you can [cancel your account here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing). 

Cancellations take full effect on the first day of the next calendar month, at which point your account will still be usable, but will be at the Free package level.  

 

We wish you the best of luck in your future email endeavors,  we'll always have Paris. <3
